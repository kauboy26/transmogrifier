# About
Transmogrifier is a compiler targeting the LC3 ISA. The project is still much underway, but a plan for it exists. Over the past few weeks, I've changed that plan multiple times, so I don't see any point in documenting it here in this README. The details of the language it compiles will definitely be published later. As for now, I am trying to get it to a decent, usable state where the compiler works if the user's syntax is sensible (if the user screws up, the compiler may or may not give a warning). Testing also seems to be a problem, so I may have to build some tools for that too.

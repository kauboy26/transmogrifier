# About
Transmogrifier is a compiler targeting the LC3 ISA. The project is still much underway, but a plan for it exists. The complete details of the language it compiles will definitely be published later. Currently these are the features that are planned (almost guaranteed to be implemented):  
* Standard arithmetic, relationational, logical and bitwise operators (no XOR though)
* Variables (of course)
* Control flow with ```if```, ```elif```, ```else``` and ```while```
* Functions
* Direct memory I/O
* An "address of" operator to find the address of some variable
* Variable length arrays that can be created on the stack
* Strings (on the stack)
* Console input / output

If possible, I will do these too:  
* Short circuit logical evaluation
* A version of malloc
* Optimization (probably not)
* Garbage collection (definitely not)

For now, you can find the syntax by looking at the sample files provided.
